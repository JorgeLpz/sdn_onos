[ONOS](https://onosproject.org/) is an open source SDN controller specifically designed for service providers. Which we will teach how to install and use, as well as run some attacks on the SDN. We will be using mininet to emulate the topology. 

# Mininet

[Mininet](http://mininet.org/) is a network emulator which allow us to create a realistic virtual network, running real kernel, switch and application code, on a single machine (VM, cloud or native), in seconds. Mininet can be installed in your laptop and complex networking solutions and topologies can be tested out with ease.

# Tutorials

This repository contains several guides on how to install and work with ONOS. And it is also focused on implementing, detecting and mitigating HTTP DDoS attacks. Below is the list of all the tutorials.
